# Procedural n-pedal Locomotion
A Unity project to handle procedural walking animations for n-pedal entities (non-bipedal, non-humanoid creatures with n > 2 limbs and different weight distributions).

The project was initially inspired by [Codeer's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6Gjhr1IP6w) on the subject.
